# Here is your `libtinfo.so.5`
This repository contains a single file: the 32 bit version of the dynamic library `libtinfo.so.5`
In a time of need, nixpkgs had no good way to obtain this file reasonably. If you want to do stuff like host dedicated servers for Team Fortress 2, this file is necessary.
